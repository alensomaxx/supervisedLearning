    "(in the next part) an optimum threshold value is calculated. This value is that threshold value, at which the true +ve rate is highest, and the false +ve rate is lowest. At this value, Area Under the Curve (auc) is maximum. AUC, higher the better, should be closer to 1. AUC represents, the probability of the +ve instance to be actuallly correctly predicted as +ve without any bias.\n",
