Types of Data 
Strutcutred Data and Unstructured Data 

Staryuctured Data : ORganized as rows and columns

Unstructured Data 

Everry entry of the data into the unstructered data types has a unique identifier that allows data management

3 examples of unstructured Data platform
 Querrying Data on Structured data patterns?

Feature Engineering : Key definintion with explanation with examples 
4 approuches / methods 
a. Tranformation
	Log transformation , Box-cox, Square root
b. imputation
	Missing values, handling 
c. scaling 
	min-max, standard Scaling 
d. encoding 
	label , one hot encoding 


Data Pre-Porcessing:
	Handling outliers :: Vinsorization 
All the points mentioned in feature engineering (all) apply here for data preprocessing 
Theory details + coding snippets (with proper syntax)


Data Visulaization:
Simple direct application of matplot library and the seaborn library
Line PLOT , Scatter plot, bar graph, heat map etc 

Data visualization techniques as discussed in  notebooks - classification notebooks and Linear regression notebooks

Highlight the importance of Seaborn Librabry ::
		 with very less code data anytics based exaples can be accoumplished 
		FMRI datasets and the lineplot example

Linear Regression: TV marketing and sales datasets implemented for linear regression
see the satistical outputs like MSE for training and mse for testing 

"Coeficient of regression is called as R^2 Score" from best-fit score 
it should be close to 1
higher the better 


Goals and Objectives of all the satistical outcomes 
	Regression
R^2 Score 
MSE
MAE
	Classification
Accureacy
precision
recall
specificity
f1score
