## üí° Overview

This repository focuses on key areas of supervised learning, including:

* **Data Preprocessing and Visualization** üìä: Using libraries like **Pandas** and **Seaborn** to clean, prepare, and understand data.
* **Feature Engineering and Selection** ‚öôÔ∏è: Techniques for creating meaningful features and reducing dimensionality (**PCA**).
* **Model Implementation** üíª: Building and applying various models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **k-NN**, **SVM**, **Na√Øve Bayes**, and **Ensemble Methods** (Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting).
* **Model Evaluation and Tuning** üìà: Assessing model performance using metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) and optimizing hyperparameters (**Grid Search**, **Random Search**).
* **Regression** üìâ: Implementing different regression models (Linear, Polynomial, Ridge) and **Time Series Forecasting** (ARIMA/SARIMA).
* **Deployment** üöÄ: Utilizing **Pickle** and **Streamlit** for basic model deployment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage

To run the practicals in this repository, you will typically need the following libraries. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Prerequisites

* Python (3.x recommended)
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/alensomaxx/supervisedLearning.git](https://github.com/alensomaxx/supervisedLearning.git)
    cd supervisedLearning
    ```

2.  **Install the necessary packages:**
    (A `requirements.txt` file is usually included in a production repository, but based on the practicals, you'll need the following):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn statsmodels streamlit
    ```

3.  **Run the individual practicals:**
    Navigate to the directory of the practical you wish to run and execute the Python script.

    *Example:*
    ```bash
    python practical_1_data_viz.py
    ```

Happy Learning! üöÄ
